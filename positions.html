                        We have <b>2 Postdoc Fellow</b> openings:<br><br>
                        <p><b>1)</b> Postdoctoral researcher will work on a TUBITAK-1004 Project "Developing 3D Bioprinting methods and creating a human brain model" <br>
                        Collaborator: <a href="https://suimc.sabanciuniv.edu/profdr-bahattin-koc">Bahattin Koc (Sabanci University)</a><br></p>
                        <p><b><i>Role Description:</i></b> The aim of this project is to develop advanced 3D bioprinting methods and stem cell technologies to create physiologically relevant human brain models that closely mimic the structure and function of the human brain for disease and drug testing. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the project team will optimize bioprinting methods and utilize stem cell technologies to generate 3D human brain models with the most accurate representation of human brain physiology and function. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a more effective and accurate platform for preclinical testing, which has the potential to improve the success rate of drug development and ultimately lead to better treatment options for patients with neurological disorders.</p>
                        <p><b><i>What you will need:</i></b><ul>
                            <li>A PhD in a relevant field (e.g. bioengineering, molecular biology, neuroscience, biophysics, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Strong knowledge of stem cell biology, particularly in the context of endotelial and neural differentiation and maturation</li>
                            <li>Experience with culturing and manipulating stem cells, particularly human-derived cells</li>
                            <li>Knowledge of neurobiology and the structure and function of the brain</li>
                            <li>Experience with imaging and electrophysiology techniques</li>

                        <p><b><i>Preferred:</i></b> <ul>
                            <li>Experience with 3D bioprinting methods and tissue engineering</li>
                            <li>Experience with designing and carrying out in vivo experiments</li>
                            <li>Experience with computer-aided design (CAD) software</li>

                        </ul></p>

                        <p><b>2)</b> Postdoctoral researcher will work on a ERC-Starting Project "META-Brain: Deciphering METAstasis of lung cancer to BRAIN and developing new therapeutic approaches via a human metastatic cascade platform"</a><br></p>
                        <p><b><i>Role Description:</i></b> The aim of this project is to establish a human-based <i>in vitro</i> platform that comprehensively replicates the journey of cancer cells from the lungs to the brain. This platform will be instrumental in addressing three pivotal questions: (1) What is the mechanism by which cancer metastasizes to the brain? (2) What role does the blood-brain barrier (BBB) play in cancer metastasis to the brain? and (3) How and when can we effectively treat cancer metastasis? By creating a physiologically relevant human cell-based model, META-BRAIN will, for the first time, delineate the entire cascade of cancer metastasis and enable the exploration of novel target proteins at the blood-tumor barrier (BTB). Additionally, this model will serve as the foundation for developing innovative shuttle systems designed for drug delivery to the brain.</p>
                        <p><b><i>What you will need:</i></b><ul>
