                        <p><b><i>Role Description:</i></b> The aim of this project is to develop advanced 3D bioprinting methods and stem cell technologies to create physiologically relevant human brain models that closely mimic the structure and function of the human brain for disease and drug testing. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, the project team will optimize bioprinting methods and utilize stem cell technologies to generate 3D human brain models with the most accurate representation of human brain physiology and function. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a more effective and accurate platform for preclinical testing, which has the potential to improve the success rate of drug development and ultimately lead to better treatment options for patients with neurological disorders.</p>
